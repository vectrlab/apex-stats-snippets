# APEX STATS Code Snippet Library

APEX STATS is a set of editable, modular resources that use Python as instructional technology to make it easier for instructors to teach introductory statistics.

The goal of the APEX STATS modules is to teach statistical reasoning and concepts through examples that incorporate Python. The modules expose students to Python gradually and provide low-stakes opportunities for them to modify code to perform analysis. This is a <i>stats-first</i> approach, not a Python-first approach, which means that Python background is not necessary to progress through the content. Rather, students will find themselves growing comfortable with Python as they discover it to be useful for their goals. Similarly, instructors can use APEX STATS modules to teach statistical concepts without needing to emphasize Python. Meanwhile, the Python code is always visible and editable for students and instructors to discover the fun challenge of computer programming.

APEX STATS is aligned to the California Transfer and Articulation System, <a href="https://www.c-id.net">C-ID</a>, for <a href="https://www.c-id.net/descriptors/final/show/365">Introduction to Statistics</a>. Therefore, it should be useful for any California community college course in 

APEX STATS is a work in progress! We are taking an iterative, instructor-centered design approach. Your feedback about what is working and not working in APEX STATS will be used to help improve the project.
