# APEX STATS Code Snippet Library

Code snippets are blocks of code. Once an APEX STATS dataset is loaded, any code snippet can be run in any order. Code snippets can perform calculations, run analysis, or generate new data. Code snippets can be linked together to create a module.

## Quick Start

If you are new to APEX STATS, start with the <a href="https://github.com/vectrlab/apex-stats-modules/">Modules</a>.

## About APEX STATS

APEX STATS is a set of open, editable, and modular resources that use Python as instructional technology to make it easier to teach introductory statistics.

The goal of the APEX STATS modules is to teach statistical reasoning and concepts through examples that incorporate Python. The modules expose students to Python gradually and provide opportunities for them to modify code to perform analysis. Prior Python background is not necessary to progress through the modules. Students will grow more comfortable with Python as they discover how useful it is. Instructors can use APEX STATS modules to teach statistical concepts without needing to emphasize Python. Meanwhie, the Python code is always visible and editable for students and instructors to discover the fun challenge of computer programming.

APEX STATS is aligned to the California Transfer and Articulation System, <a href="https://www.c-id.net">C-ID</a>, for <a href="https://www.c-id.net/descriptors/final/show/365">Introduction to Statistics</a>. Therefore, it should be useful for many introductory statistics courses and any California college course. 

APEX STATS is a work in progress. We are taking an iterative, instructor-centered design approach. Your feedback helps us improve the project.

APEX is the <a href="https://sjsu.edu/apex/">Applied Computing Programming Experiences</a> project at San Jos&eacute; State University.
